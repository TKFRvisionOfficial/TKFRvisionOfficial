## What's up üòÅ!




### About Me

My name is **Klemens**. I do things!
<br><br>
I mainly do Python things. But I also do *insert language/technology/framework here* things.
<br>
I do binary reverse engineering things, parsing things, but also API things.

Lot's of my things are licensed "All Rights Reserved" but that is just laziness. Hit me up if you want me to add a FOSS license to one of my projects.

If you want to follow me on other sites just go through my [<img alt="linktree" width="20px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/h90nveymaytblh5fldz8" />](https://linktr.ee/tkfrvision).
