## What's up üòÅ!




### About Me

My name is **Klemens**. I do things!
<br><br>
I mainly do Python things. But I also do *insert language/technology/framework here* things.
<br>
I do binary reverse engineering things, parsing things, but also API things.

Lot's of my things are licensed "All Rights Reserved" but that is just laziness. Hit me up if you want me to add a FOSS license to one of my projects.

If you want to follow me on other sites just go through my [<img alt="linktree" width="20px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/h90nveymaytblh5fldz8" />](https://linktr.ee/tkfrvision).

### üî≠ Latest releases I've contributed to

- [offsetting/offsetting](https://github.com/offsetting/offsetting) ([v0.2.1](https://github.com/offsetting/offsetting/releases/tag/v0.2.1), 7 months ago) - A collection of modding tools based on the libraries created by Team Offsetting.
- [smessmer/binary-layout](https://github.com/smessmer/binary-layout) ([4.0.2](https://github.com/smessmer/binary-layout/releases/tag/4.0.2), 11 months ago) - The binary-layout library allows type-safe, inplace, zero-copy access to structured binary data. You define a custom data layout and give it a slice of binary data, and it will allow you to read and write the fields defined in the layout from the binary data without having to copy any of the data. It&#39;s similar to transmuting to/from a #[repr(packed)] struct, but much safer.
